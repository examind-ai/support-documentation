# Tactical Deterrents

## Overview

Our evidence-based approach to cheating detection warns students when they engage in behavior connected with misconduct, and registers that activity for review.

{% hint style="info" %}
Public information on our deterrents is kept to a minimum. This helps us minimize the likelihood of students reverse engineering or overcoming these deterrents.

For more information, email [**support@examind.io**](mailto:support@examind.io).
