# Schedule

## Accessing Schedule

1. Click **Assessments** in the left menu
2. Click the desired assessment
3. Click **Schedule** in the left menu

## Configure Options

* **Time Limit:** Set a time limit for the assessment.
* **Number of Attempts:** Set a maximum number of attempts for the assessment.

{% hint style="info" %}
Leaving the number of attempts blank will allow unlimited attempts for the assessment.
{% endhint %}

## Availability

Click **ADD AVAILABILITY** to add an availability window. Availability windows can be set for the following:

* **Everyone:** Set the availability window for every student in the Roster.
* **Section:** Set the availability window for a specific section.
* **Student:** Set the availability window for a specific student.

{% hint style="info" %}
The most specific rule applies. For example, if you set an availability window for everyone to be January 1 from 1:00-2:00 pm, and another availability window for a specific student from 3:00-5:00 pm, then that specific student would only have an availability window from 3:00-5:00 pm.
{% endhint %}

## Extensions

Click **ADD EXTENSION** to add an extension for a specific student.

* **Time Limit:** Sets a new time limit for the specified student.
* **Number of Attempts:** Sets a new number of attempts for the specified student.

{% hint style="info" %}
Extensions are automatically applied if they have been configured in your LMS or in the Roster menu in EXAMIND. They will display as "extended by #x" or "extended by X minutes".
{% endhint %}
