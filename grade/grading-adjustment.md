## Point Adjustments

There are two ways to make point adjustments:

1. By Student
2. By Question

{% hint style="info" %}
Point adjustments are made by first clicking on a student or a question and then following the instructions below
{% endhint %}

### Adjustments by Student

Inside of a student's results page, there are two boxes to the right of the question number:

1. **Override Score**: A place for you to input the new points awarded
2. **Points Earned**: Displays the points awarded

{% hint style="info" %}
Numbers in the Override Score box will automatically adjust the Points Earned box.
{% endhint %}

### Adjustments by Question

Inside of a question results page, there are two **BULK ACTIONS** that can be performed:

1. Omit Question from Assessment
2. Give Full Credit

Simply toggle on your preferred grading adjustment and click **SAVE CHANGES**.

{% hint style="info" %}
It can take up to 5 minutes for all results to be recalculated after you perform a bulk action.
