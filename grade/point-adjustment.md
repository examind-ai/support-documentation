### Making Point Adjustments

There are two ways to make point adjustments:

1. By Student
2. By Question

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="BY STUDENT" %}
This tab shows each assessment by student. Information includes:

* Student
* Section
* Attempt
* Start Time
* Time Taken
* Score&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Select the student to see their assessment.
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="BY QUESTION" %}
This tab shows each information by question. Information includes:

* Title&#x20;
* Type
* Blooms' Taxonomy
* Average Score
* Correct %
* Times Served

{% hint style="info" %}
Select the question Title to see a student's response to a specific question.
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### Making Adjustments by Student

For each question there are two boxes presented to the right of the question number.&#x20;

1. **Override Score**: In the Override Score box you can input the new points awarded.
2. **Points Earned**: The points earned will display the points awarded.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you input a new number in the Override Score box it will automatically adjust the Points Earned box.
{% endhint %}

#### Making Adjustments by Question

For each student listed by Question you can enter a new score in the Override Score box. If you want to adjust the question for all students select **BULK ACTIONS**.

You will be presented with two different bulk adjustment options:

1. Omit Question from Assessment
2. Give Full Credit

Simply toggle on your preferred grading adjustment and select SAVE CHANGES.

{% hint style="info" %}
When bulk adjustments are made, a new line under the question will appear which states "Question omitted by instructor" or "Full credit given by the instructor" to help the instructor track grading adjustments. The new point values will be reflected throughout the different result tabs.
{% endhint %}
