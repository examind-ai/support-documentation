# Offline Behavior

## Overview

When a student disconnects from the internet during an assessment, the student can continue working seamlessly without interruption. Offline progress is queued and automatically saved to the server upon reconnection. Tactical deterrents also function offline for enhanced academic integrity.

Inside of the assessment, student can see a subtle indication that they are offline. This design optimizes focus for a student so they are free from distraction.

If a student remains offline when they submit their assessment, one of following three things will occur:

### Scenario 1

A student comes back online _before_ they submit their assessment or run out of time.

**Result:** Everything if fine and all progress is uploaded to the server

### Scenario 2

A student comes back online _after_ they submit their assessment or run out of time.

**Result:** Changes made offline are saved, but held for a review. EXAMIND's Support team is notified immediately on submission and will examine the assessment's logs within the same business day. If no suspicious behavior is present, the assessment is finalized and added to the results page. If there is indication of suspicious behavior, the instructor is informed and presented evidence to make a decision on how to proceed.

### Scenario 3

A student attempts to close their browser while offline.

**Result:** A browser-system warning will appear to notify the student that changes may not be saved if they proceed.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is important that students do not close the browser until their progress has been submitted to the server. Progress will be lost if a student ignores this message.

## Offline Submissions

The User Interface (UI) will adapt for students who are offline. If there are any unsaved changes the student went offline, we will display the following on screen.

After 10 seconds of attempting to connect, the screen will update.

At any time during this waiting period, if the student attempts to close their browser, the browser-system warning will appear.&#x20;

## Time Limit Reached

If the student runs out of time while offline and there are unsaved changes, the "time ran out" message will update accordingly.

At any time during this waiting period, if the student tries to close their browser, they will see the same browser-system warning.

## **Computer Shutdown**

If the student shuts down the computer while offline, there is a chance that the student won't receive the browser warning that they risk losing data. This problem is more prevalent on computers running Windows than computers running macOS.

Regardless of the operating system used, it is advisable to ask students not to attempt a computer shutdown until they receive confirmation that their assessment has been submitted successfully.
