# The Backpack

## What Is the Backpack

The **Backpack** allows you to store and transfer blocks across different questions or courses. By dragging blocks into the backpack, you can easily save useful code snippets or frequently used blocks, which can then be dragged back onto the workspace when needed. This helps streamline question building.

The backpack is an icon in the top right of the Dynamic Engine. It looks like this:

## How It Works

To use the backpack, follow these simple steps:

1. **Drag Blocks to Backpack**: Click and hold the block you wish to store, then drag it into the backpack icon located on the interface.
2. **Store Your Blocks**: Release the mouse button to drop the block into the backpack. The backpack can hold multiple blocks and is useful for transferring snippets across projects.
3. **Retrieve from Backpack**: To use a block from the backpack, click on the backpack icon, then drag the block from the backpack onto the workspace.
4. **Manage Backpack Content**: You can clear the backpack or individually remove blocks as needed, ensuring you keep only the most relevant pieces at your fingertips.
