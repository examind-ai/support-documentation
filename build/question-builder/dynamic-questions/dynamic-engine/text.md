## The Text Blocks

There are twelve kinds of _text_ blocks you can use in the Dynamic Engine. This article focuses on the top five blocks that you will use:

1. Basic
2. Create Text With
3. Append Text
4. Set Letter Case
5. Random Text

### Text: Basic

The **basic** block assigns a text value to a variable of your choosing. For example, this sets the value of the variable named "first name" to the text "John".

<figure><img src="https://instructor-help.examind.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202024-06-03%20at%207-27-47%20PM-png.png?width=575&#x26;height=84&#x26;name=Screen%20Shot%202024-06-03%20at%207-27-47%20PM-png.png" alt="" height="84" width="575"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Examples of pieces of text are:

* "John"
* "thing #1"
* "March 12, 2010"
* "Who framed Roger Rabbit?"

Text can contain letters (which may be lower-case or upper-case), numbers, punctuation marks, other symbols, and blank spaces between words. The conventional term for all of these different types of text is "characters".

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that nothing between two quotation marks represents empty text, and looks like this ""
{% endhint %}

### Text: Create Text With

The **create text with** block lets you mix different blocks to create a combined string of text. For example, this sets the value of the variable named "full name" to the text "John Doe".

<figure><img src="https://instructor-help.examind.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202024-06-03%20at%207-29-18%20PM-png.png?width=575&#x26;height=90&#x26;name=Screen%20Shot%202024-06-03%20at%207-29-18%20PM-png.png" alt="" height="90" width="575"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Notice how the two **basic** text blocks that are being combined are "John" and " Doe". You also have the option to add more or less blocks by pressing the "+" or the "-".

{% hint style="info" %}
Be mindful of spaces in text blocks. There is an intentional space added in the " Doe" text to create "John Doe".
{% endhint %}

### Text: Append Text

The **append text** block lets you add values to the end of a variable. For example, this sets the value of the variable named "first name" to "John" and then adds the text "Doe" to the end. The end result is that the variable named "first name" will now show "John Doe".

<figure><img src="https://instructor-help.examind.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202024-06-03%20at%207-31-32%20PM-png.png?width=575&#x26;height=75&#x26;name=Screen%20Shot%202024-06-03%20at%207-31-32%20PM-png.png" alt="" height="75" width="575"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Text: Letter Case

The **set letter case** block lets you format your values. For example, this sets the value of the variable named "full name" to "John Doe".

<figure><img src="https://instructor-help.examind.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202024-06-03%20at%207-34-39%20PM-png.png?width=575&#x26;height=49&#x26;name=Screen%20Shot%202024-06-03%20at%207-34-39%20PM-png.png" alt="" height="49" width="575"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

There are 3 options when you select the dropdown:

1. UPPER CASE
2. lower case
3. Title Case

### Text: Random Text

The **random** block lets you save time by selecting from pre-populated datasets. For example, this sets the value of the variable named "first name" to a random female first name, such as "Anna".

<figure><img src="https://instructor-help.examind.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202024-06-03%20at%207-35-39%20PM-png.png?width=575&#x26;height=69&#x26;name=Screen%20Shot%202024-06-03%20at%207-35-39%20PM-png.png" alt="" height="69" width="575"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Datasets can be select by clicking the dropdown menu next to the word "random". The current datasets available are the following:

* **City** - 89,500+ fake cities
* **Company** - 18,000+ fake companies
* **Country** - 244 real countries
* **First Name** - 3,000+ ethnically diverse names
* **First Name (Female)** - 450+ ethnically diverse female names
* **First Name (Male)** - 400+ ethnically diverse male names
* **Industry** - 148 real industries
* **Last Name** - 450+ ethnically diverse last names
* **Month** - 12 months
* **Weekday** - 7 weekdays

## Example Question

Consider the following Multiple Choice question in EXAMIND.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-12-05 at 4.55.36 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The goal with this question is to create independent variables that don't affect the question. These variables enable EXAMIND to identify the source of leaked content (if this question appears online). This works because each student is served a unique permutation of the question.\
