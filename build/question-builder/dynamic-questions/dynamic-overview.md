# Dynamic Overview

## Dynamic Questions

Dynamic Questions are questions with randomized parameters. What that means is that variables within the question are randomly changed, based on a set of rules. With dynamic questions, you can randomize numbers, formulas, words, phrases, or anything else you can think of.&#x20;

### Why Are Dynamic Questions So Important?

Dynamic questions are critical for maintaining academic integrity for 3 reasons:

1. Minimizing the advantage of group collaboration
2. Making it hard to find solutions online
3. Deterring students from posting questions online

Universities now realize that students are constantly finding ways around lockdown browsers and online proctoring. It’s a never-ending battle with no end in sight.

Once students find a way around technology that attempts to stop the “act” of cheating, they gain advantages through group collaboration and online websites. Some of the websites where exam questions and solutions can be found are [Chegg](https://www.chegg.com/), [Course Hero](https://www.coursehero.com/), and [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/). At EXAMIND, we call this _compromised or vulnerable content_.

Dynamic questions are important because they help address both group collaboration and finding solutions online. With dynamic questions, every student receives a personalized question variant during their assessment.

Rather than trying to stop the “act” of cheating, dynamic questions focus on trying to eliminate the “advantage” of cheating. This approach transcends across assessment delivery methods, as it can be very effective for online exams delivered in-person as well.

## How They Work

Dynamic questions are not that complicated. Below is a question based on an introductory course in accounting. The point of this example is to show you how variables can be changed and explain their purpose.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/60e43e8d3135096ad9a3f593_LR4SRlAWVjyrjiZtwHttQdsjT8cwWgPeVrCPo1mGT1U9x2IFHePZylRqp2hdogQtoSkJG0p-3pYXXSYEeOzn1MwGjUHKs_eLwOzIGoZHBgaZvhterO0YMY9L0mzHMQ.webp" alt=""><figcaption><p>Example of a multiple-choice question</p></figcaption></figure>

Above is the original question with no dynamic variables. It doesn’t look much different than any other original (normal) question you might on an exam. That’s by design. Dynamic questions don’t look or feel any different to a student on purpose. Now, here is the same question with the dynamic variables highlighted for you:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/60e43ea6010f6b39ade28801_aMBtPrd-4Rg2lanCuTYtSyEkfHNjodGgf_P_dWNqahupxYI22aTg5g7D9xsO4_HX_MR3nw5P4as3H9imSa1M9NS_WC7ZEfSPnMcBE_kZ44-M-AqoQSfYH-Zax01Dlg-1.webp" alt=""><figcaption><p>Example of a dynamic multiple-choice question</p></figcaption></figure>

Notice that all of these highlighted variables have the potential to be changed into something else. By turning the highlighted variables into randomized parameters, we can make a large number of question variants from just this one original question.

### Dependent & Independent Variables

Before we go through the exact steps on how to make a dynamic question, let’s take a closer look at the variables to understand how they affect the quality of the dynamic question.&#x20;

First, it is important to understand the difference between variables that have a direct effect on the answer choices and those that do not impact the answers at all. We refer to variables that influence the answer as _"dependent variables"_. These are important because dependent variables change the correct and incorrect answer choices in a question, making collaboration more difficult. We call variables that don’t influence the answer _"independent variables"._ These are important because they can help identify students who are posting questions online (more on that later).

A good dynamic question uses a mix of dependent and independent variables. In our example above, we have 4 dependent variables:

* Purchase price of the equipment is **$2,130,000**
* Useful life of the equipment is **5 years**
* Estimated residual value is **15% of cost**
* Depreciation method is **Straight-line**

With each new question variant, there is a new set of answer choices. The more variation we introduce into dependent variables, the greater the number of possible answers there are for students.&#x20;

We also have 2 independent variables in the example above:

* Company name is **Boardwalk Pharmaceutical**
* Type of equipment is **Furniture**

These variables do not affect the answer. What they do is make a question more identifiable. A question with more unique components makes it easier to identify which student posted your question online.

### Why Are Independent Variables Critical?

One of the biggest challenges educators face today is compromised content. Students are sharing exams, assignments, and test bank questions online to collaborate on solutions and make it easier to cheat together. Without dynamic questions, they can do this anonymously.

With dynamic questions, the unique combination of dependent and independent variables create what we call a Digital Fingerprint. A digital fingerprint provides proof of which student compromised your content online. With this proof, we can have the content removed from online websites and take any other necessary actions.

Another benefit of independent variables is leveraging the paraphrasing effect. When we use paraphrased or altered questions, communicating in real time becomes more difficult.

During an exam, Student A may text Student B and say, “What did you get for the Boardwalk Pharmaceutical question?” The response would be, “I don’t have that question.” Then, Student A might try again with something like, “The one on straight-line depreciation”. To which the reply would be, “I got one on double-declining balance.”

You get the idea. The bottom line is that dynamic questions make collaboration more difficult, as students are receiving different variations of the question and confuse each other when communicating.

### **How are Answers Randomized?**

By now, we have shown you how you can randomize variables in the question stem. The next step is to show you how dynamic questions randomize the answer choices as well. More importantly, we should talk about creating “smart” answer choices.

Answer choices are randomized with dynamic questions. Not only do we randomize the order in which answers are presented, but we also tie the choices to the dependent variables in the question stem. In other words, if the Purchase Price changes, so does the calculated answer choice.

This becomes even more powerful when we use dynamic functional distractors. In other words, when we look at the above example, the answer choices calculate common mistakes that students make based on the variables in the question stem.

One common mistake is calculating the straight-line depreciation when the student should have calculated the double-declining balance, and vice versa. Things get really interesting when the stem changes from straight-line to double-declining balance, because the correct answer choice changes as well.

In both scenarios, both the straight-line and double-declining balance choices are presented. But the correct choice changes according to the question stem’s variable.

When we create dynamic functional distractors, we make a tremendous improvement to the question’s ability to discriminate knowledge.

## Create a Dynamic Question

### **Step 1: Write Question**

Input your question into EXAMIND's question builder.

### **Step 2: Identify and Name Variables**

Identify and name variables that can be either dependent or independent variables. Here is an example based on our previous accounting example:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/60ee11da39fab445f55b22ee_Screen Shot 2021-07-13 at 3.20.35 PM.webp" alt=""><figcaption><p>Table of variables and thought process</p></figcaption></figure>

### **Step 3: Specify Rules**

Create the rules for each variable. Here is an example of the rules for each variable we created:

**Boardwalk Pharmaceutical**

Create a random company name. This is an independent variable and EXAMIND makes it really easy to assign a random company name via pre-populated lists.&#x20;

**Furniture**

Create a list of furniture. If you know accounting, some equipment might not be considered depreciable. In this case we don’t want to select something from a random database of equipment. Instead, you should create a customized list. For example, tell EXAMIND to randomly pick any of the following:

* manufacturing
* furniture
* long-term office
* warehouse

#### **Purchase Price**

Pick a random number between 10,000 and 10,000,000, in increments of 5,000. I could have picked any number range, but remember we want to try to make this realistic for the student. For this reason, I also made the increments stay nice and round, which are easier to work with.

#### **Useful Life**

Set a range for the useful life that makes sense with accounting rules. In accounting you can’t depreciate something forever. So I just had to use some common sense. I ended up with a range of numbers between 3 and 10 years, in increments of 1 year.

#### **Residual Value**

Set the range for the residual value. In this case, set it between 1 to 30%, in increments of 1%. Once again, we are trying to keep things realistic to the question.

#### **Depreciation Method**

Randomly pick the depreciation method as either straight-line or double-declining.

### **Step 4: Create Answers**

Similar to what we did in Step 3 for the variables in our question stem, now specify the rules for the answer choices.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/60e43ea6010f6b39ade28801_aMBtPrd-4Rg2lanCuTYtSyEkfHNjodGgf_P_dWNqahupxYI22aTg5g7D9xsO4_HX_MR3nw5P4as3H9imSa1M9NS_WC7ZEfSPnMcBE_kZ44-M-AqoQSfYH-Zax01Dlg-1.webp" alt="60e43ea6010f6b39ade28801_aMBtPrd-4Rg2lanCuTYtSyEkfHNjodGgf_P_dWNqahupxYI22aTg5g7D9xsO4_HX_MR3nw5P4as3H9imSa1M9NS_WC7ZEfSPnMcBE_kZ44-M-AqoQSfYH-Zax01Dlg"><figcaption><p>Example of a dynamic multiple-choice question</p></figcaption></figure>

In our example question, the correct choice is tied to the depreciation method. We need to tell EXAMIND what formula to use to derive the answer, based on the depreciation method.&#x20;

#### **Correct Choice 1: Straight-line Depreciation**

If the question asks for straight-line depreciation, the correct is based on the formula used to calculate straight-line depreciation:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/60e43fc60503952c73f63bb7_tALhXo3qEB6aNDOXaTRFFlHWjVuCDuLBthEq6u6iW1GmafYDK3GXbr7ImplyTJ3NDKKKTZej_2HFQ_V8_cCxZHYe6tYh9fslO2yzvBgf39ilOLHF6STru7BjfSVDBA.png" alt="60e43fc60503952c73f63bb7_tALhXo3qEB6aNDOXaTRFFlHWjVuCDuLBthEq6u6iW1GmafYDK3GXbr7ImplyTJ3NDKKKTZej_2HFQ_V8_cCxZHYe6tYh9fslO2yzvBgf39ilOLHF6STru7BjfSVDBA"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Which translates to...

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/60e43fdb02c6206f57e19872_TxvITfzHxdKGV9dng3tulAfRlIC7uzCv_R4M3MPl7HSxTMSD-I0yi4hmeMhve5QNuKwp0RC3_FQA3xUgJ9tGXB7CLJDUlWOIoOb4eEUAqaNRT0AWT-3ExSTS04Gh2Q.png" alt="60e43fdb02c6206f57e19872_TxvITfzHxdKGV9dng3tulAfRlIC7uzCv_R4M3MPl7HSxTMSD-I0yi4hmeMhve5QNuKwp0RC3_FQA3xUgJ9tGXB7CLJDUlWOIoOb4eEUAqaNRT0AWT-3ExSTS04Gh2Q"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### **Correct Choice 2: Double-declining Balance Depreciation**

If the question asks for double-declining depreciation, the correct is based on the formula used to calculate double-declining depreciation:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/60e43feed4637e6d48c8d343_JPQJLPte2kNqUOinjbMea1cs3iIGFFjjS0vqHjFu32EZNgSVH8zx0y0XKF4ZlpnRh6dWda52MmAgdP6XHnxYWb0S9QigtGvKYMNe6r0raY2ODVqjVnki1rOqeAvmaw.png" alt="60e43feed4637e6d48c8d343_JPQJLPte2kNqUOinjbMea1cs3iIGFFjjS0vqHjFu32EZNgSVH8zx0y0XKF4ZlpnRh6dWda52MmAgdP6XHnxYWb0S9QigtGvKYMNe6r0raY2ODVqjVnki1rOqeAvmaw"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Which translates to...

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/60e44003528074772b627d76_tfK6I-r6Nn1z0JVHENwYMPmK_otEtwmNfTInMCmyb5QIzBK8HsnI2H4JWrFmkDexPETIeKNKV1wZesrc9naXe9slMT3vV467he-19VsIxpnqqkYOWUnNmO92DPlRww.png" alt="60e44003528074772b627d76_tfK6I-r6Nn1z0JVHENwYMPmK_otEtwmNfTInMCmyb5QIzBK8HsnI2H4JWrFmkDexPETIeKNKV1wZesrc9naXe9slMT3vV467he-19VsIxpnqqkYOWUnNmO92DPlRww"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Notice how both the answer for straight-line depreciation ($362,100) and double-declining balance depreciation ($852,000) show up in the answer choices? This was by design. In order to create good functional distractors, you want to create incorrect answers that are commonly made mistakes.

What other common mistakes do students make in this scenario?  They often forget to subtract the residual value when calculating straight-line depreciation. So we included this as one of the answer choices ($426,000). Another common mistake when calculating double-declining depreciation is to just simply multiply the straight-line depreciation by two. We also included this common mistake in the answer choices ($724,000). Now we have a really great question!

We have now turned an ordinary question into a dynamic question! Now you have nearly unlimited variations of your question!

In the above example we looked at a numerical question. Dynamic questions can also be created for non-numerical questions. This is why what we are doing is so powerful. We aren’t limited to numerical questions. Let’s give it a try using the same steps we used before on a question without numbers.

### **Dynamic Question Without Numbers**

Here is a question we designed for a finance course:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/60ee161ca29d1826b4e1eb4b_Screen Shot 2021-07-13 at 3.34.14 PM.png" alt="60ee161ca29d1826b4e1eb4b_Screen Shot 2021-07-13 at 3.34.14 PM"><figcaption><p>Example of a multiple-choice question for finance</p></figcaption></figure>

Now, here is the same question with the dynamic variables highlighted:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/60ee164365373ebb252e0de1_Screen Shot 2021-07-13 at 3.39.00 PM.png" alt="60ee164365373ebb252e0de1_Screen Shot 2021-07-13 at 3.39.00 PM"><figcaption><p>Example of a dynamic multiple-choice question for finance</p></figcaption></figure>

### **Step 1: Write Question**

Just copy and paste the above question into EXAMIND’s question builder.

### **Step 2: Identify and Name Variables**

Once again, plan out which variables to change and name them. Below is a summary of the categories I created for this question:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/60ee166ac089df98d3445644_Screen Shot 2021-07-13 at 3.40.31 PM.png" alt="60ee166ac089df98d3445644_Screen Shot 2021-07-13 at 3.40.31 PM"><figcaption><p>Table of variables and thought process</p></figcaption></figure>

### **Step 3: Specify Rules**

Specifiy the rules for each of the variables. Below are the rules for each variable: &#x20;

#### **Personalized Technology**

This is an independent variable.  Assign a random company name from a list of company names.

#### **LIFO, FIFO**

LIFO (Last In First Out) and FIFO (First In First Out) are types of accounting methods used to measure inventory. These are dependent variables because they directly impact our answer. The only rule we have to set up is to have EXAMIND randomly pick between LIFO and FIFO. If EXAMIND picks LIFO, then it will automatically compare it to FIFO.&#x20;

#### **Lower**

Here the question is simply asking the student to identify what ratio in the final answer will be lower. We want this variable to change between “higher” and “lower”. All we need to do is have EXAMIND randomly choose either “higher” or “lower” for the variable.&#x20;

#### **Inflationary**

Lastly, we have the term inflationary. This variable just tells us if prices are going up or down. If prices are going up we will call this variable “inflationary” and when they are going down “deflationary”. Now we tell EXAMIND to randomly pick either inflationary or deflationary.&#x20;

### **Step 4: Create Answers**

For this particular question, Step 3 was pretty straight forward. Step 4 of this question requires us to have a pretty in depth understanding of finance and accounting in order to specify the answer choices. Let’s make this as easy as possible.

First, we need to identify which ratios we are going to use as potential answers. For this question we are going to consider the following ratios:

* Acid Test Ratio
* Asset Turnover
* Current Ratio
* Days of Inventory on Hand
* Inventory Turnover&#x20;
* Gross Margin&#x20;

It doesn’t matter if you don’t understand what these ratios mean. Just try to understand how we are setting up the potential answers.

Now we need to tell EXAMIND when these answer choices are correct based on different scenarios. There are a lot of different scenarios in this question. For ease of discussion, I will only go through one scenario.

Let’s consider when the question asks us to use FIFO, when the direction of the ratio will be higher, and the cost environment is deflationary. In this scenario, there are three potentially correct answers and three potentially incorrect answers as follows:

#### **Scenario: FIFO, Higher, and Deflationary:**

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/60ee16eba5d8583ab77c6d44_Screen Shot 2021-07-13 at 3.42.39 PM.png" alt="60ee16eba5d8583ab77c6d44_Screen Shot 2021-07-13 at 3.42.39 PM"><figcaption><p>Table of variables and thought process</p></figcaption></figure>

Based on this scenario, we need to build some logic into EXAMIND. All we need to do is build some “if then” logic into EXAMIND. We tell EXAMIND that “if” the scenario is FIFO, Higher, and Deflationary, “then” randomly pick one of the correct answers from the correct answer list and then randomly select the remaining answer choices from the incorrect answer list.

We repeat this process for the other potential scenarios. However, each scenario will require us to create a new correct and incorrect answer list because the answers will change based on the scenarios.

Now you have another dynamic question. This is a very powerful question because it requires the students to understand how accounting ratios change in different contexts.&#x20;

## **Conclusion**

You don't need to spend hours creating versions of questions or exams any more. Create a dynamic question once and you can have limitless permutations of the question. Following the steps outlined in this article you can create unlimited new question variants and exam versions in a matter of minutes.

This approach allows you to easily give unique assessments to every student thereby increasing academic integrity because it makes it much more difficult for students to cheat.

At EXAMIND we are ready to help you start building dynamic questions and creating better exams in a fraction of the time. \
