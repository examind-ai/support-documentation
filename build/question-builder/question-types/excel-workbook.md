# Excel Workbook

## Overview

Excel workbook questions enable students to work directly inside Excel with a direct connection to EXAMIND. Using a specialized plugin, students input a unique code to launch their EXAMIND question. When they are complete, they can click a button inside of Excel to submit their work to EXAMIND's autograder. This type of question is ideal for courses that require data analysis, financial modeling, statistical computations, or spreadsheet-based problem-solving.

### Why Use It

This question type allows students to practice real-world skills. They can format data, apply formulas, create charts, and run analyses as they would in a professional setting, bridging theoretical concepts and practical application.

* **Hands-On Practice:** Students gain proficiency in spreadsheet tools widely used in industry.
* **Complex Data Analysis:** Easily handle large datasets, perform calculations, and visualize results within the question interface.
* **Authentic Assessment:** Closely mimics on-the-job tasks, enhancing studentsâ€™ career readiness.

### Use Cases

* **Accounting and Finance:** Create financial models, forecast cash flows, or prepare budgets.
* **Statistics and Data Analysis:** Run descriptive statistics, regression analyses, or create pivot tables from provided datasets.
* **Operations Management:** Model inventory decisions, optimize supply chain scenarios, or simulate queuing mod

## Create and Configure

{% hint style="info" %}
This question type is only available in closed beta. For more information, email [**support@examind.io**](mailto:support@examind.io).
{% endhint %}

## Instructor Tips

### Ensuring Academic Integrity

* **Randomized Data Sets:** Use different data sets for each student or each attempt, making it harder to share answers.
* **Time Limits:** Set a reasonable time limit for accessing and submitting the Excel workbook to reduce external collaboration.

{% hint style="info" %}
To improve academic integrity, EXAMIND wipes all data in their workbook when they input their code to gain access to a question. Then, it adds a unique ID to every workbook to prove if a student attempts to use another student's work.
{% endhint %}

### Common Issues

* **Students overwrite reference cells or instructions:** Lock these cells or provide a protected sheet.
* **Plugin Installation:** Students sometimes wait until the last minute to install the excel plugin. Conduct a low-stakes assignment at the start of your course to mitigate this issue.

### Best Practices

* Provide a practice assignment so students get comfortable with the Excel integration before a graded task.
* Offer a rubric that clarifies which aspects (correctness, formatting, analysis) carry the most weight.
* Encourage students to double-check calculations and charts before submission.
