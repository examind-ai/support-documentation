# Multiple Choice

## Overview

A Multiple Choice Question presents students with a single question followed by a set of possible answers. Students must select the one best answer from the provided options.

The key to a good multiple choice question lies in creating really good distractors.

### Why Use It

This question type is tool suitable for quickly gauging studentsâ€™ factual knowledge, conceptual understanding, or the application of theories. They can be automatically graded, making them efficient for both high-enrollment lecture courses and smaller seminar-style classes.

* Reinforces key terminology, concepts, or principles in a low-stakes quiz setting.
* Offers immediate feedback to help students identify gaps in their knowledge.
* Well-designed distractors can encourage critical thinking by challenging common misconceptions.

### Use Cases

* **Knowledge Checks:** Test foundational understanding of course material before deeper discussions.
* **Reading Quizzes:** Ensure students complete and comprehend assigned readings.
* **Exam Questions:** Provide a fair and standardized means of assessing a wide range of course content.

{% step %}
### Add Randomization

Use the + and x symbols to add more correct and incorrect alternatives. EXAMIND will only show one correct choice at a time.

**Points:** The default point value for this question in an assessment

**Choices:** The total number of choices to display (ex. 4 would show choices A-D). Useful for increasing randomization

**None of the above:** Add a "none of the above" answer choice to the bottom of each question and EXAMIND will randomly serve this as a correct answer choice.

## Instructor Tips

### Ensuring Academic Integrity

* **Randomization:** Shuffle answer choices for each student attempt.
* **Dynamic Questions:** Use a combination of independent and dependent variables.
* **Time Limits:** Set a time limit if desired to reduce the likelihood of external help.
* **Question Pools:** Draw from a bank of related questions to increase randomization.

### Common Issues

* **Overly Vague Question Stems:** Make sure the question stem clearly indicates the context.
* **Unclear Distractors:** If too similar, consider adjusting wording for clarity.

### Best Practices

* Run a quick pilot with a colleague or teaching assistant to ensure clarity.
* Review student results post-quiz. If many students choose a certain distractor, it might be misleading or identify a gap in instruction.
