# Journal Entry

## Overview

A Journal Entry Question asks students to record accounting transactions in a general ledger format. The student is required to specify which accounts are debited, which are credited, and the corresponding amounts.

### Why Use It

This question type is effective for developing practical bookkeeping skills and reinforce their understanding of fundamental accounting principles. They encourage learners to think critically about how transactions affect the accounting equation (Assets = Liabilities + Equity) and ensure that they understand the rationale behind debits and credits.

* Encourages application of theoretical accounting principles to realistic scenarios.
* Reinforces accuracy, attention to detail, and logical reasoning in financial record-keeping.
* Prepares students for more advanced topics and professional accounting tasks.

## Instructor Tips

### Ensuring Academic Integrity

* **Variations in Transactions:** Change the details or amounts for different student attempts.
* **Dynamic Questions:** Use a combination of independent and dependent variables.
* **Unique Scenarios:** Use a diverse set of transactions from multiple chapters or unit topics.
* **Limited Time Windows:** Give students a set amount of time to complete the question.

### Common Issues

* Students may reverse the debit and credit sides. Provide guidelines and reminders: “Debits on the left, Credits on the right.”
* Confusing Expense vs. Asset Accounts: Clarify which accounts represent assets acquired (e.g., supplies) versus expenses (e.g., when supplies are used).

### Best Practices

* Start with simple transactions and progress to more complex adjustments as the course advances.
* Encourage students to write down the accounting equation and think through the impact of each transaction before deciding on debits and credits.
