# Builder Overview

## Block-based Editor

EXAMIND uses a block-based editor, which allows instructors to place any questions type in any combination.

To add an question type answer block, start a new line and click the **+** icon.

### Multi-Step Questions

To create a multi-step question, simply add more answer blocks with the + button.

### Explanations

Answer explanations are completed in the text field below the question editor.

### Dynamic Questions

Dynamic questions allow personalization of questions at scale. There is no known limit to the number of permutations for the engine. It is common to see questions with a trillion trillion variations of equal difficulty.

Dynamic questions enable a digital fingerprint, which makes identification of leaked content and its source both accurate and reliable. For more information, email [**support@examind.io**](mailto:support@examind.io).
