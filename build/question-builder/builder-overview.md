# Builder Overview

## Block-based Editor

EXAMIND uses a block-based editor, which allows instructors to place any question type in any combination.

To add an question type answer block, start a new line and click the **+** icon.

### Multi-Step Questions

To create a multi-step question, simply add additional answer blocks with the **+** icon.

### Explanations

Answer explanations are completed in the text field below the question editor.

### Dynamic Questions

Dynamic questions allow personalization of questions at scale. There is no limit to the number of question permutations. It is common to see questions with a trillion variations of equal difficulty.

Dynamic questions enable a digital fingerprint, which makes identification of leaked content and its source both accurate and reliable. For more information, email [**support@examind.io**](mailto:support@examind.io).
