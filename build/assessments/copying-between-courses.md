# Copying Between Courses

## Preparation

You will need access to both the original course and the new course in order to proceed.

Follow these instructions on [how to create a new course](../../get-started/standalone-use/course-management.md#create-new-course).

## Copy Assessments Between Courses

Follow these steps to mirror one or more assessments into another course.

1. Navigate to the course that has the original assessment(s)
2. Click **Assessments** in the left menu
3. Click the **Checkbox(s)** to select the assessment(s) you want to copy
4. Click **Bulk Actions**
5. Select **Add to Course**
6. From the dropdown, select the new course where you want the assessment copied.
7. Click **Add**
8. Click **OK**

{% hint style="info" %}
All questions tied to this assessment will automatically be added to the new course's question bank
{% endhint %}

## Special Considerations

{% hint style="warning" %}
Assessments copied between courses **remain linked**.

Editing one assessment **automatically updates the other**, helping you maintain across multiple sections at scale.

These updates **do not** affect assignments that have already been submitted.
{% endhint %}

To manage each course separately, duplicate the copied assessment after adding it to the new course. This will create an independent version.

### How to Duplicate an Assessment

1. Click **Assessments** in the left menu
2. Locate and click the **3 Dot Menu** at the end of the row
3. Select **Duplicate**
