### Exam/Quiz/Practice

Exams, quizzes, and practice assessments require three steps to build an assessment:

**Step 1: Add Question to Assessment**

&#x20;Click the box next to the question title in your question bank to add the question to the assessment.

**Step 2: Verify Question Included in Assessment**&#x20;

Questions added in Step 1 will appear in the assessment window on the righthand side.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The number of questions, question pools, and points associated with the assessment will automatically update as you add questions.
{% endhint %}

To remove a question from the assessment, simply uncheck the box next to the question title in your question bank.&#x20;

**Step 3: Set Question Order**

By default, questions are ordered by question type into Question Groups and randomized within each group. You can make the following changes:

1. **Create New Groups**: Click the **+** button after clicking on the question group title
2. **Fix Question Order**: Click the crossed arrow icon.
3. **Combine Question Groups**: Click on a question in the assessment window and drag into a different question group.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Question Group titles will be presented to the student. One tip is to combine all questions into one group and rename the group the assessment title (e.g. Final Exam). In other cases you may want to fix long workout problems as the last questions in the exam.
{% endhint %}

### Essays and Simulations

Essay and Simulation assessments requires three steps:

1. Enter Instructions
2. Select AI Model
3. Enter AI System Prompt

Information included in the instructions text field will be presented to the student.
