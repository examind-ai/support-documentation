# Post Grades

## Accessing EXAMIND LTI Page

1. Navigate to the assessment in your LMS that is linked to EXAMIND
2. Click on **EXAMIND** assessment to load EXAMIND LTI page

## Exams, Quizzes, and Practices

### Post Grades

1. Click **Post Grades**
2. Choose between `New submissions only` and `All submissions`
3. Verify grades have been imported into your LMS

## Essays and Simulations

### Send Results

* Click **Send Results**

When sending essay and simulation results to Canvas, the system automatically uploads a PDF containing the student's complete results to SpeedGrader alongside the numerical grade.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**All submissions:** Updates all grades in the LMS for this assessment. This will override any manual adjustments made directly in the LMS with the grades stored in EXAMIND.

**New submissions only:** Sends grades only for students whose results have not yet been posted to the LMS, preserving any existing grades and manual adjustments.

In order to post grades to Canvas, the following conditions must be met:

* Course must have started
* Course cannot have ended
* Course must to be published (even if posting grades for `Test Student`)
* If posting grades using the `All submissions` option, each grade post counts as an attempt in Canvas, so ensure sufficient attempts are allowed in the Canvas assignment
