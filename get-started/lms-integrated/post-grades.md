# Post Grades

## Accessing EXAMIND LTI Page

1. Navigate to the assessment in your LMS that is linked to EXAMIND
2. Click on **EXAMIND** assessment to load EXAMIND LTI page

## Post Grades

1. Click **Post Grades**
2. Choose between `New submissions only` and `All submissions`
3. Verify grades have been imported into your LMS

{% hint style="warning" %}
Choosing `All submissions` will update and override all grades linked to EXAMIND's assessment. EXAMIND does not automatically post grades in order to protect any changes you have made inside your LMS.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
In order to post grades to Canvas, the following conditions must be met:

* Course must have started
* Course cannot have ended
* Course must to be published (even if posting grades for `Test Student`)
* If posting grades using the `All submissions` option, each grade post counts as an attempt in Canvas, so ensure sufficient attempts are allowed in the Canvas assignment
