# Brightspace

From the course page, click **Existing Activities** and select **EXAMIND** (or the name your IT gave EXAMIND during **LTI Tool Installation**).

On the first time adding an assessment into Brightspace, you will be asked to select an EXAMIND course to link this course to.

Either select an existing course in EXAMIND or create a new one.

If you have already linked an EXAMIND course, you will be asked to select an assessment in EXAMIND. Either select an existing assessment or create a new one:

If you select the New Assessment option, it will be named **LTI Assessment** by default. Rename it in Brightspace.

Open the activity, click **Edit**, and rename it in EXAMIND:

EXAMIND's assessment is now available as an activity in Brightspace.

## Special Considerations

Students extensions needs to be configured in both Brightspace and EXAMIND. Refer to the [scheduling page](../../../deliver/schedule.md) on how to configure extensions in EXAMIND.
