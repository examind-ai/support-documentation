When you first launch the EXAMIND tool, you will be asked to select an EXAMIND course to link this Brightspace course to.

Either select an existing course in EXAMIND or create a new one.

If you have already linked an EXAMIND course, you will be asked to select an assessment in EXAMIND. Either select an existing assessment or create a new one:

If you select the New Assessment option, it will be named **LTI Assessment** by default. Rename it in Brightspace.

Open the activity, click **Edit**, and rename it in EXAMIND:

EXAMIND's assessment is now available as an activity in Brightspace.
