# Roster Sync

1. Has it been more than 24 hours since the last Roster Sync?
2. If yes, a roster sync will automatically occur

{% hint style="info" %}

Once students and instructors launch into the course (and if the LMS is configured to pass this information during the LTI handshake), section information will start to appear for individual roster members.
{% endhint %}
