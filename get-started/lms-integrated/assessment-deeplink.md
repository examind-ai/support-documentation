## Blackboard

The steps to deep link to an EXAMIND assessment will differ depending on whether you're using Blackboard Classic or Blackboard Ultra.

### Blackboard Ultra

Go to a course and locate the Course Content section in the middle of the page. Click on the plus icon to add content and then select Content Market from the options available.

In the Content Market, Institution Tools will be located in the lower pane. Find the tool labelled Assessment. This will open the EXAMIND LTI Tool.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/content-market-png.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Create a new course in Examind with matching criteria to the current course.

### Blackboard Classic

Navigate to a course, and select Content in the left hand tab.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/course-content-png.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Select Build Content > Assessment. This will open the EXAMIND LTI.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/build-content-png.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Create a new course in EXAMIND with matching criteria to the current course.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/create-course-png-1-1.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
Students extensions needs to be configured in both Blackboard and EXAMIND. Refer to the [scheduling page](../../deliver/schedule.md) on how to configure extensions in EXAMIND.
{% endhint %}

## Brightspace

Go to a course in Brightspace, then select **Existing Activities**, then **EXAMIND** (or a different name selected during **LTI Tool Installation**):

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image-png-1.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If this is your first time adding an assessment into this Brightspace course, you'll be asked to select an EXAMIND course to link this course to.

Either select an existing course in EXAMIND or create a new one:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image-png-2 (1).webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If you've already linked an EXAMIND course, you'll be asked to select an assessment in EXAMIND. Either select an existing assessment or create a new one:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image-png-3.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If you select the New Assessment option, by default it will be named **LTI Assessment**. Rename it in Brightspace:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image-png-4.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Open the activity, click Edit, and rename it in EXAMIND:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image-png-Apr-26-2024-05-09-05-6994-AM.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

EXAMIND's assessment is now available as an activity in Brightspace.

{% hint style="info" %}
Students extensions needs to be configured in both Brightspace and EXAMIND. Refer to the [scheduling page](../../deliver/schedule.md) on how to configure extensions in EXAMIND.
{% endhint %}

## Canvas

Create a new assignment in Canvas. Give it an **Assignment name**, then set the number of **Points**:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/canvas-assignment-title.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Set **Submission Type** to **External Tool**, then click **Find**:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/canvas-assignment-tools.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Select the EXAMIND LTI Tool:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/canvas-assignment-tools-examind.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If this is the first time you're setting up and EXAMIND assignment for this Canvas course, you will be asked to create a matching course in EXAMIND. Check that the information is correct before proceeding. Pay particular attention to start date and end date, as they should match the start and end dates in Canvas.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/canvas-link-resource.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Check **Load This Tool In A New Tab** and leave **Allowed Attempts** as **Unlimited** even if you don't intend to allow more than one attempt. The allowed attempt will be controlled in EXAMIND's UI later. Optionally assign **Due** date. If you leave **Due** date blank for now, be sure to set it later. Leave **Available from** and **Until** blank for now. We will come back to it later.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/canvas-assignment-config.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Save** the assignment.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image-png-Jun-13-2024-01-52-01-3033-AM.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Select **External Tool**:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image-png-Jun-13-2024-01-52-27-9515-AM.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Leave **Activity name** blank for now; it will auto-populate. Choose **EXAMIND** from the **Preconfigured tool** dropdown, then click the **Select Content** button:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image-png-Jun-13-2024-01-53-11-2640-AM.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
