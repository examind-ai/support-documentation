# Information for Students

## What is EXAMIND?

EXAMIND is a learning and assessment platform designed to minimize stress. We prioritize a seamless technology experience and neuroscience to enhance student performance. Our software is designed to uphold academic integrity without sacrificing student experience. It ensures academic integrity without using intrusive technologies like webcams or lockdown browsers. No installation is required to use the software.

## Student Access

EXAMIND is integrated with your universityâ€™s learning management system (LMS). To access EXAMIND you will need to log into your course. Assessments will be set up under the assignments section. After you click on the associated assignment, a new browser tab will automatically open to launch EXAMIND.

Within the student dashboard, you can navigate to your course and assessment. When you first enter into the dashboard, you will be given the opportunity to take a product tour. The tour is designed to help you learn how to navigate our platform. We encourage you to take the product tour to familiarize yourself with EXAMIND.

## System Requirements

EXAMIND is a browser-based platform so no installation is required. We recommend using Google Chrome, Safari 15.0+, Firefox or Edge. We also recommend updating your web browser before your assessment.

A computer is recommended for taking your assessment. We do not recommend using a mobile device, such as a smartphone or tablet. For the best experience, please use a computer.

## Assessment Guidelines

For rules of behavior during your assessment please refer to the direct instructions of your instructor. EXAMIND uses dynamic questions and randomization techniques to ensure that no students gain an unfair advantage when taking an assessment.

In addition to these techniques, the instructor has the ability to enable certain warning features for students engaged in cheating behavior. If triggered a dialog box will appear and the student must acknowledge the warning before returning to the assessment. The instructor will be notified when such warnings are triggered.

## Support

If you have any questions or if you are experiencing technical issues with EXAMIND please contact us directly at [support@examind.io](mailto:support@examind.io) before reaching out to your professor. We will be available to answer any questions you have.

We are confident that you will enjoy your assessment experience with EXAMIND. We wish you the best of luck this semester!
