# Information for Students

## What is EXAMIND?

EXAMIND is a learning and assessment platform designed to minimize stress. We prioritize a seamless technology experience and utilize neuroscience to enhance student performance. Our software is designed to uphold academic integrity without sacrificing student experience. It ensures academic integrity without using intrusive technologies like webcams or lockdown browsers. No installation is required to use the software.

## Student Access

To access EXAMIND, log into your course's learning management system (LMS) and navigate to the assessment. Click on the assessment, and a new browser tab will automatically open to launch EXAMIND.

Upon entering the student dashboard, you can navigate to your course and assessment. Initially, you will be given the opportunity to take a product tour, which is designed to help you learn how to navigate our platform. We encourage you to take the product tour to familiarize yourself with EXAMIND.

## System Requirements

EXAMIND is a browser-based platform so no installation is required. We recommend using Google Chrome, Safari 15.0+, Firefox or Edge. We also recommend updating your web browser before your assessment.

A computer is recommended for taking your assessment. We do not recommend using a mobile device, such as a smartphone or tablet. For the best experience, use a computer.

## Assessment Guidelines

For rules of behavior during your assessment, refer to the direct instructions of your instructor. EXAMIND uses dynamic questions and randomization techniques to ensure that no student gains an unfair advantage when taking an assessment.

In addition to these techniques, the instructor can enable certain warning features for students engaged in cheating behavior. If triggered, a dialog box will appear, and the student must acknowledge the warning before returning to the assessment. The instructor will be notified when such warnings are triggered.

## Support

If you have any questions or experience technical issues with EXAMIND, please contact us directly at support@examind.io before reaching out to your professor. We will be available to answer any questions you have.

We are confident that you will enjoy your assessment experience with EXAMIND.
